The following is the code that was developed and used throughout in my research paper to obtain the results
This code employs heat transfer equations alongside the finite difference method to compute the results
This is done by simulating the heat transfer of a heat sink, which can be modified, in 2 dimensions at steady state
Various parameters set in the beginning dictate the nature of the heat transfer
